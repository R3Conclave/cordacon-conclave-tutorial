# Welcome to Conclave!

This SDK provides everything you need to start building secure enclaves.

In the `docs/` directory you will find a website that contains detailed guidance on how to use this SDK.
This is the same website available at [docs.conclave.net](https://docs.conclave.net).

In the `repo/` directory there is a Maven repository that provides all the libraries you'll need in your
project. The documentation will show you how to configure your project to use the files within.

The `sources.zip` file contains a subset of the Conclave source code, released in order to meet the terms
of the OpenJDK GPL2+Classpath Exception license.

If you get stuck please contact [conclave@r3.com](mailto:conclave@r3.com) and ask for help!
